# Internationalization 

ILC comes with built in internationalization support, so you can easily run micro frontends on the websites which 
require support of the multiple languages.

However, you need to keep in mind that ILC does only part of the job for you. Support of the i18n capabilities from the 
micro frontends side is required.

## Routing

TBD, cover app side & ILC side, provide sample code

## Synchronized language/currency change

TBD, sample code should be provided
